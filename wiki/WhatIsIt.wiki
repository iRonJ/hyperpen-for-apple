Short information about the tablet and motivation to write a userland driver for OSX.

= Introduction =

The 12000U is a (legacy) entry level tablet by [http://www.aiptek.eu Aiptek]. Drivers are provided for Windows Systems and older versions of OSX (even OS9!). But I had a hard time to find a driver that would run with 10.6. Google led me to some obscure pages that claimed to have the latest drivers (but didn't) and so I wasted a lot of time to no avail.  

Some years ago I stumbled over tablet magic which is geared at legacy Wacom tablets (the high end of the market). The support for serial tablets was dropped when newer Mac systems arrived with USB and Fire Wire only. But Thinkyhead Software came up with a smart solution that captured and interpreted the commands received on the serial port and converted it to the tablet events needed by the system.
