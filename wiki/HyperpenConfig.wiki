= Introduction =

Some of you have wished for a utility to configure the driver. The main feature you needed was a little dialog and circumvent the command line to set the options for your tablet. So I have put together `hyperpenConfig`. You can download the app in the Downloads section.

The following screent shots show you how to use it


= Details =

1. When fired up it shows its main dialog. You see one of the machine's devices that qualifies as a HID device. The configuration is read during application startup. If you connect the tablet after the application is running it won't be recognized.

2. Select the tablet in the drop down box.

3. If you do so, the tablet's capabilities will be shown. You can see width and height of the tablet. Next you see that the button (Save Configuration ...) is enabled. By selecting the ratio that matches your screen, you change the logical height of the tablet.

4. When you select (Save Configuration ...) a file dialog pops up. Now you navigate to the directory you want to save the driver to. You have the option to create a new directory to host the driver and a command file to start the driver with the right configuration. I have created a directory "test" to store these. Now you select (Save hyperpenDaemon) and the files are saved into this directory.

That was the one trick the hyperpenConfig does. You can quit the application and use your tablet with the selected configuration from now on.

5. You find two files in the directory you pointed the application to. One is the driver called "hyperpenDaemon". The other one is the command file "daemonStarter.command". To start the driver with the right configuration you double click on the command file.

Happy drawing with your preferred drawing app thereafter.

If you need to reconfigure the tablet later on: Start over at step 1. You can select the same target directory and `hyperpenConfig` will overwrite the command file without further questions.

You can open `daemonStarter.command`with your favorite text editor and change or add parameters manually.
