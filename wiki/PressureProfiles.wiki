=Pressure Profiles=

Normally the pressure you impose on the pen is reported as such to the system. If your pen supports 512 pressure levels, then 0 will be reported as 0 and 511 as 1 to the system. So 255 is 0.5 and so on. This behavior is standard and most of the time expected. But what do you do if you need another behavior, one that allows you to simulate a hard or a soft pen for example? You can either purchase a professional application (e.g. Photoshop) that allows you to define pressure profiles or you can rely on my driver to do this for simpler applications as well.

To define the pressure profiles I have developed a utility that does just that. It's name is `pressureProfile`and you start it by double clicking in the finder.
