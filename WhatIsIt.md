Short information about the tablet and motivation to write a userland driver for OSX.

## Introduction ##

The 12000U is a (legacy) entry level tablet by [Aiptek](http://www.aiptek.eu). It is a rebranded [Waltop](http://www.waltop.com.tw) tablet. Drivers are provided for current Windows versions (including Windows 7) and older versions of OSX (even OS9!). But I had a hard time to find a driver that would run with 10.6. Google led me to some obscure pages that claimed to have the latest drivers (but didn't) and so I wasted a lot of time to no avail.

Some times ago I stumbled over tablet magic which is geared at legacy Wacom tablets (the high end of the market). The support for serial tablets was dropped when newer Mac systems arrived with USB and Fire Wire only. But Thinkyhead Software came up with a smart solution that captures and interprets the commands received on the serial port and converts it to the tablet events needed by the system. By reusing the event generation part of the software I got a quick start for my code.

My main task was to capture the USB reports generated by the tablet and convert them in a way they can be fed into the code of TabletMagic. That way I was able to write this driver as userland code, not needing any kernel extensions at all.
