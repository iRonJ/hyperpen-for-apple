October 2013: I have stopped support for this project and am not planning to update the driver any longer.
The driver still works for current versions of OSX.

## Universal OSX driver for low cost tablets ##

You are looking for a driver that supports the tablet features of low-cost tablets under OSX?

Not just mouse mode but real tablet features like absolute positioning, stylus pressure, and function keys?

Additional you get multi monitor support, reduced jitter by averaging, adjustable levels of pressure and other features.

Satisfied users tell me the driver works with your _Waltop_, _Aiptek_, _Medion_, _Trust_, _Silvercrest_, _Genius_, _Adesso_ and other **non Wacom** tablets.

Recently [Ray Frendon](http://www.frendon.com/) discovered, the driver can be used with _[Yiynova MSP19](http://www.amazon.com/Yiynova-Tablet-Monitor-light-MSP19/dp/B005EJAU9S/ref=pd_bxgy_pc_text_y)_ as well. This is a screen/tabet combination, I hadn't heard of before.

Most of you should go with **hyperpenConfig**, which will help you to set up the driver with the right parameters for your tablet. HyperpenConfig tells you more (updated 10/12/2012) - see screenshot below.

Or download the driver (found in the **[Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/hyperpen-for-apple/downloads/list)** section) and follow the instructions: GettingStarted. The driver and its sources have been downloaded **2,000+** times by your peers. The responses so far where all in all very positive.

```
Please uninstall the software included with your tablet, before starting the driver!
```

If you have problems with pressure support in Adobe Illustrator have a look at [issue 5](https://code.google.com/p/hyperpen-for-apple/issues/detail?id=5).

Please leave your comments or feature requests in [issue 7](https://code.google.com/p/hyperpen-for-apple/issues/detail?id=7) section of the project.
